# go-kerbal (WIP)
 
This will eventually be a Go clone of the Kerbal [CKAN Mod Manager](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN). This uses the metadata files from [CKAN-Meta](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN-meta). I used [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) to build the UI.

I use CKAN every time I play KSP. This project is mostly to get comfortable with Go. I would like to have this functional and ready to port for KSP 2 whenever that is released.

## To run
```
go build && ./go-kerbal
```
## Features so far:
 * Automatically keeps metadata up to date
 * Search through mods
 * View logs in-app
 * Download, install, and remove mods
 * Automatically check for conflicts/dependencies
